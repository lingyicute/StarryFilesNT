The **Bookmarks** toolbar displays bookmarks contained within the *Bookmarks Toolbar* folder.

Opening a bookmark
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Clicking a bookmark will navigate the current tab to the location of that bookmark, while clicking a bookmark folder will show the items it contains in a dropdown menu.

Middle-clicking a bookmark will open it in a new tab, while middle-clicking a bookmark folder will open the items it contains in new tabs.

When clicking or middle-clicking an item, the :kbd:`Ctrl` and :kbd:`Shift` keys can be used to control whether the item is opened in a new background or foreground tab.

Context Menu

Right-clicking on an item in the **Bookmarks** toolbar will show a context menu for that item.

It's possible to add bookmarks by dropping a file or folder on the bookmarks toolbar. Additionally, bookmarks can be rearranged by dragging and dropping them into new positions.
