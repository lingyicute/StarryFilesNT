Exit
----

This menu item exits **StarryFiles++**. Prior to closing, **StarryFiles++**

- saves settings to an XML file (config.xml) in the same folder as
  *StarryFiles++.exe*, or
- saves settings to the Windows registry,

depending on the setting for :ref:`portable
<menus/tools/options/general:Run in portable mode>` mode.

The window close button and closing the last remaining tab in the files
pane (subject to an :ref:`option <menus/tools/options/tabs:Close the
main window when closing the last tab>`), perform the same operations as
**Exit**.
