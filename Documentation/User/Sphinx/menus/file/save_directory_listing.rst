Save Directory Listing...
-------------------------

This menu item performs a simple directory (folder) listing and saves it
as a text file. A *Save As* Windows dialog allows the user to save the
file in any location, under any name.

The listing only contains file/folder names, sorted in alphabetical
order; folders are identified with "(Folder)" appended. Note that the
file is saved in Unicode format (codepage = UTF-16 LE), with a BOM (byte
order mark = FFFE hex) header. Windows Notepad can read this file format
and can save the file is ANSI format, if desired.
