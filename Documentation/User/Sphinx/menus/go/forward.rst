Forward
-------

:kbd:`Alt` + :kbd:`â†’`

**StarryFiles++** maintains a list of previous locations, or history, for
each tab. The **Forward** (and :doc:`Back <back>`) items on the **Go**
menu can walk through this history, much like hyperlinks in HTML
browsers (eg. Mozilla Firefox).

**Forward** returns the currently active tab to a newer location,
closest to the current location in the history. If this item is
disabled, the Files pane (active tab) is displaying the newest location
in the history.

See :ref:`here <menus/go/back:History>` for a more detailed explanation
of a tab's history.
