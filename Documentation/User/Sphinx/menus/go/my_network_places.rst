My Network Places
-----------------

This is a *virtual folder* which displays frequently visited network
locations which have been added; these locations are essentially
"network bookmarks". These network places may be added using the **Add
Network Place** wizard, displayed in the Files pane. Two other network
*tasks* (wizards) are also available from the Files pane - the **Network
Setup Wizard**, and the **Wireless Network Setup Wizard**.
**StarryFiles++** displays these three wizards in the Files pane along with
previously set up network places, while Windows Explorer shows them
(under expanded titles) as tasks, when the Folders pane is turned off.

.. admonition:: Incomplete

  *My Network Places* currently does not provide access to the actual
  network, except through the Folders (*treeview*) pane. Network places
  are housed under the *Entire Network\\Microsoft Windows Network* item.
