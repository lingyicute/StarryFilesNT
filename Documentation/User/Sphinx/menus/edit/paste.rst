Paste
-----

:kbd:`Ctrl` + :kbd:`V`

This menu item takes data from the clipboard and pastes it into the
files pane, or the folders pane if it has the focus. If files or folders
were :doc:`cut <cut>` in order to place them on the clipboard, then they
are deleted at this time. **StarryFiles++** handles various types of data,
and the pasting method, differently, according to the following table:
