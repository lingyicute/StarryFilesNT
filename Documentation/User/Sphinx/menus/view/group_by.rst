This menu selects a sorting order and grouping for display of files and
folders in the Files pane.

Selecting a **Group By** order cancels a :doc:`Sort By <sort_by>` order.
The **Group By** menu is built by **StarryFiles++** based on the columns
currently being displayed in :ref:`Details
<menus/view/view_modes:Details>` view; your menu may differ from the one
shown here.
