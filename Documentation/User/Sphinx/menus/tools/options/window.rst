Allow multiple instances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+-----------------+-----+
| System Default: | Yes |
+-----------------+-----+

By default, **StarryFiles++** allows multiple instances of itself, that is,
you may open more a one copy of **StarryFiles++**. Each new copy can have
its own set of tabs and settings, etc., subject to information below.
If this option is disabled (box unchecked), ie. *do not allow multiple
instances*, then attempting to open a second copy of **StarryFiles++** (eg.
by double-clicking on a shortcut) will open a :doc:`new tab
<../../file/new_tab>` instead.

.. note::

  While multiple instances of **StarryFiles++** are open, each copy
  maintains tab and settings information in its own memory space.
  However, on closing, each copy will write complete settings
  information to the Windows registry (or :ref:`config.xml
  <menus/tools/options/general:Run in portable mode>` file). Closing the
  next copy will **also** do this, overwriting the settings from the
  first. This means that the **last** closed instance of **StarryFiles++**
  ultimately determines the settings (and tab information) saved for the
  next session. This behavior is by design.

.. tip::

  If you have multiple copies of **StarryFiles++** open, the one with your
  **preferred tabs** (and settings) should be **closed last**. If
  multiple instances are being used along with :ref:`portable
  <menus/tools/options/general:Run in portable mode>` mode, you can make
  a backup copy of your config.xml file.

Tab bar settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Always show the tab bar
+++++++++++++++++++++++

+-----------------+-----+
| System Default: | Yes |
+-----------------+-----+

Disabling this option causes the :doc:`Tab bar <../../../panes/tab_bar>`
to disappear (ie. not displayed) when only 1 tab is open. If 2 or more
tabs are open, this setting has no effect.

Show the tab bar at the bottom
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+-----------------+----+
| System Default: | No |
+-----------------+----+

The :doc:`Tab bar <../../../panes/tab_bar>` is normally displayed at the
top of the Files pane; enabling this option (ie. checking the box)
displays tabs at the bottom, just above the :doc:`Status Bar
<../../view/status_bar>` (if enabled).

Extend tab bar across entire window
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+-----------------+----+
| System Default: | No |
+-----------------+----+

With this option disabled, the :doc:`Tab bar <../../../panes/tab_bar>`
extends only the width of the Files pane. Enabling this option displays
the Tab bar the full width of the window; more tabs can be displayed in
this mode.

Title bar settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These settings modify **StarryFiles++**'s title bar, which normally only
displays the current folder, followed by "StarryFiles++". A sample title
bar follows, showing only the current folder ("AtomExplorer").

Note that these options may be enabled in any combination. The more
options enabled, the longer the window title.

Show full path in title bar
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+-----------------+----+
| System Default: | No |
+-----------------+----+

Enabling this setting displays the full path to the current folder. The
following image demonstrates this.

Show username in title bar
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+-----------------+----+
| System Default: | No |
+-----------------+----+

Enabling this setting displays the current user's name (actually the
*owner* of the **StarryFiles++** process), preceded by the domain name. The
domain name refers to the location of the user's account, which could be
another computer on a network. In most cases, individual computers will
just show "DESKTOP" signifying this is a local account/user.

Show privilege level in title bar
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

+-----------------+----+
| System Default: | No |
+-----------------+----+

Enabling this setting displays the user's *privilege level*, as
determined by the type of his account. This is usually one of

- **Administrators** - high privilege, unrestricted access to all
  computer functions
- **Power Users** - extensive rights, but may not be allowed certain
  administrative tasks (eg. take ownership of files)
- **Users** - fewer rights. This prevents accidental changes to the
  system.
- **Guests** - fewer rights than Users

Full row selection in details view
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+-----------------+----+
| System Default: | No |
+-----------------+----+

Normal selection of an item in details view just highlights the
left-most column (usually Name). In order to select that item, the
left-most column must be clicked; clicking on another column has no
effect.

.. image:: /_static/images/mnu_tools/select_normal.png

However, when this option is enabled, the full row is highlighted;
selection may be done on any column.

Disable treeview delay
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

+-----------------+-----+
| System Default: | Yes |
+-----------------+-----+

**StarryFiles++** can, if desired, introduce a 500 millisecond delay
between selecting a folder in the Folders pane (ie. treeview control)
and opening its contents in the Files pane. This delay is entirely
*cosmetic*; it may prove useful for users who navigate the folder tree
using the keyboard. With the delay, using the up/down arrow keys would
not open the folders contents for each folder as the selection was moved
up or down.

By default, this option is enabled, disabling the treeview delay;
clearing the checkbox enables the delay.
