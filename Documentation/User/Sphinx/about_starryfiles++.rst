About StarryFiles++
----------------

**StarryFiles++** is a free multi-tab file manager for the
Windows operating system, `released
<https://92li.us.kg/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&t=239>`_ as
open source under the `GNU GPLv3 license
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>`_. Windows Explorer
provides basic functionality - the ability to navigate throughout your
computer, and perform basic tasks - but **StarryFiles++** goes further,
introducing several enhancements and improvements for a much richer file
browsing experience. Aside from basic navigation, **StarryFiles++** has:

- a two paned interface, like Windows Explorer, but with multiple tabs
  in the files pane. You can have many locations open at once and
  quickly change from tab to tab.
- a :doc:`Drives toolbar <toolbars/drives>`, showing all available
  volumes - disk drives - (including network and USB drives). Jump to a
  drive with a single mouse click.
- a :doc:`Bookmarks menu <menus/bookmarks/index>` (similar to Windows
  Explorer favorites, but with more functionality), and a
  :doc:`Bookmarks toolbar <toolbars/bookmarks>`
- an :doc:`Application toolbar <toolbars/application>` where you can
  create shortcuts to your favorite applications
- :doc:`Show Command Prompt <menus/file/show_command_prompt>` built into
  **StarryFiles++**
- :doc:`attribute control <menus/file/set_file_attributes>` (set, clear)
  for multiple files
- various :doc:`methods <menus/view/view_modes>` of file display,
  including multiple :doc:`groupings <menus/view/group_by>`
- quickly :doc:`split <menus/actions/split_file>` a large file into
  pieces, for email or other purposes, and quickly
  :doc:`merge <menus/actions/merge_files>` pieces back into the
  original file
- a :doc:`destroy files <menus/actions/destroy_files>` function
  which deletes files, then wipes their former disk space clean. This
  provides secure erasing of files.
- a built-in file :doc:`search <menus/tools/search>` function which
  allows searching by name or attributes
- customized file display
  :doc:`colors <menus/tools/customize_colors>`, by name or attributes
- ability to run in :ref:`portable mode <menus/tools/options/general:Run
  in portable mode>`, storing all configuration in an XML file
- highly :doc:`configurable <menus/tools/options/general>`, for user
  preference
- full drag-and-drop support with other applications, including
  Windows Explorer
- much more...!

**StarryFiles++** requires Windows 7, 8, 10 or 11 (32-bit or 64-bit
systems) to run; there is no installation required. Windows PE is also supported.

**StarryFiles++** uses English as its native language, but can be used with
other :ref:`languages <menus/tools/options/general:Language>` through
the use of translation DLLs, available on the website. Translations are
user contributed (thanks for the work!), and as a result, some may be
incomplete.
