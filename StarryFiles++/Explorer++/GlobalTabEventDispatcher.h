class Tab;

// When there are multiple browser windows, subscribing to tab events globally becomes more
// difficult. For example, to be notified of tab events in all windows, a class would have to
// subscribe both to tab events in a window, as well as window creation events (to allow
// subscription to tab events in the new window).
// It is possible to invert this dependency, so that the tab owner notifies a class whenever a
// particular event occurs. However, that flips the usual dependency relationship.
// This class acts as an intermediate. It means that a tab owner can indicate that some event
// occurred, without having an explicit dependency on a subscriber.
// It also means that a subscriber can be notified when a tab event happens, without having to know
// exactly where that event came from.
