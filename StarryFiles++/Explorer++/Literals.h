// This exists only to serve as a form of type documentation. Constants declared with this type are
// raw pixel values, specified at 96DPI. This helps to avoid having to use constant names like
// MINIMUM_WIDTH_PIXELS_96DPI.
// Note that while names in the global namespace shouldn't start with _, it appears the _px portion
// of the literal operator below isn't a name and isn't reserved (see
// https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13793996/underscores-names-and-literal-operators). Defining
// the literal in a namespace would work, but would make using it in a header unwieldy. A "using
// namespace" declaration would be required, which couldn't be directly used in the header, so
// something like an initialization lambda would be needed instead.
// Which would defeat the entire purpose of something like this - a short literal that gives
// information about the type.
// Therefore, the literal is explicitly defined outside of a namespace.
