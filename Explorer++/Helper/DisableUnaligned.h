// __unaligned is used with some of the ITEMIDLIST helper functions (for example, ILFindLastID()
// returns PUITEMID_CHILD). However, the attribute has no relevance on x86, x64 or ARM64. Leaving it
// defined will then trigger warning C4090 ('argument': different '__unaligned' qualifiers) in
// circumstances where an __unaligned pointer is being passed to a function expecting an aligned
// pointer. Since the attribute isn't actually useful on these platforms, it's defined away. That
// then prevents the unnecessary warnings from being generated.
// Also see
